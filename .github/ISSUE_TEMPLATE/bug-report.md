> ### Please note
>
> `docx-jsx` is a wrapper around the `docx` package, adapting it for use with
> JSX syntax. Bug reports will therefore only be accepted if they fall into one
> of the following two categories:
>
> 1. A difference between working `docx` code and what you believe to be the
>    same example in JSX syntax; or
> 2. An issue with the code or types specific to this package.
>
> For anything else, you should probably either:
>
> - Raise a _feature request_ here; or
> - Raise a bug at https://github.com/dolanmiu/docx/issues.
